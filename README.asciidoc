Translators from Doxygen to DoxyPress
=====================================

:cpp: C++

Doxygen
-------

http://www.doxygen.org/[Doxygen] tool uses the abstract class `Translator` to define
API for the human-language dedicated classes, for example `TranslatorEnglish`. 
When a documentation is processed by Doxygen, the cofiguration `Doxyfile` says
what human language should be used, and Doxygen instantiates the language
specific `TranslatorXxxx` instance.


DoxyPress
---------

http://www.copperspice.com/documentation-doxypress.html[DoxyPress] was initially
a for of Doxygen. The main goals are to enhance the old functionality so, 
that it will be able to document newer features of the {cpp} language ({cpp}11,
{cpp}14, and the future specifications). The goals and the process of rewriting
were presented at

Translators Revisited (Doxygen)
-------------------------------

The Translators Revisited analysis was written in 2001 by Petr Přikryl.
It identifies some problems in Doxygen with human-language translations.
It proposes changes to the internal structure to separate the language
dependent text from the code. Because of various reasons, it was not implemented.


Converter
---------

This tool should help to extract language dependent sources from the Doxygen sources.
The goal is to take advantage of the effort of the supported human languages, and
to transfer the work of the language maintainers to the “Doxygen phoenix project”.
